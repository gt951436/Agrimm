# Agrimm

**Smart Agricultural Solutions**

*A modular AI platform for optimizing agriculture.*

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Agrimm** is an end-to-end platform offering smart agricultural solutions—starting with precision irrigation and expanding to smart fertilization, crop selection, and pest management—tailored for Indian farmers.

### MVP(for now): Smart Irrigation Advisor

* **Objective:** Predict the optimal volume of water required for specific crops and soil conditions.
* **Inputs:** Soil health metrics (pH, nutrient levels), real-time moisture data, weather forecasts.
* **Output:** Irrigation schedule and water volumes per field.
* **Benefit:** Significant water savings, reduced costs, and improved yield efficiency.

## 🔮 Future Phases

1. **Precision Fertilization**
    * Predict and recommend fertilizer type and dosage based on soil nutrient profiles and crop data.
2. **Crop-of-the-Season Recommender**
    * Suggest the best crops for upcoming seasons using market trends, climate forecasts, and soil fertility maps.
3. **IoT-Driven Pest & Disease Alerts**
    * Deploy field sensors for continuous soil & plant health monitoring. AI models flag pest/disease risks and recommend optimal chemical interventions.
